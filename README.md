# Uniform Cost Search - UCS
Implementation of algorithm Uniform Cost Search (UCS) using Python language.

Explanation about the UCS algorithm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaKEW_mVBtg

The UCS algorithm is an optimal algorithm that uses a priority queue. 

UCS is a tree search algorithm used for traversing or searching a weighted tree, tree structure, or graph. (Wikipedia).

You can set variables in the call of function "run" in the "main.py" file (example: variables "verbose" and "time_sleep").
